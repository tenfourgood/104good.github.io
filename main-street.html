			the idea and find out if people are interested in turning this idea to action.</p>
			<p class="text">Our first topic is a walkable Main Street. At least a half dozen people submitted this idea and below is a 
			Greenville News editorial by <a href="https://twitter.com/Dmarc8" title="Marc's Twitter account">Marc Bolick</a> of <a href="http://www.dmarc8.com/" title="DMarc website">DMarc8</a> on why he thinks this is a good idea.</p>

			<h1>Walking On Main Street</h1>
			<h2>By Marc Bolick</h2>

					<p class="text">We’ve all heard the story. Greenville’s downtown used to be an anti-destination. It is where you didn’t go at night or on the weekends. That has changed now, and we are all proud to show visitors how wonderful our Main Street area is. But if you had asked the average person 20 years ago whether Main Street could be a thriving hub of restaurants, shops and street festivals, most would have said "no way!"</p>
          <p class="text">By all accounts, the vision of Greenville’s leaders over three decades ago has proven accurate: if you build an attractive streetscape and provide the right incentives, you can create a vibrant and thriving downtown. I think that a key aspect of the revitalization of downtown was the so-called “road diet” that was imposed on Main Street, reducing it from four lanes to two. This was done intentionally to make the area more pedestrian friendly. So, my question now is, why not go all the way and make a large portion of Main Street pedestrian-only?</p>
          <p class="text">Think about it. When you head downtown and you turn onto Main Street anywhere between College and Broad, you just know that you’re going to end up driving slow and have very little chance of finding parking on Main itself. Just the other day around lunchtime I stood in front of the Westin Poinsett and looked north up Main Street. All I could see were cars waiting at traffic lights. I stood there imagining what it would be like to have no cars, no parking, just a wide pedestrian area with more outdoor restaurant seating, a bike lane and maybe an electric bus or trolley running down the center of Main.</p>
          <p class="text">Many people will object to this idea, and the arguments against are important to consider. Retailers on Main Street would lose the vital drive-by traffic that attracts walk-in customers. Parking capacity would be reduced (around 100 spaces). And, perhaps most compellingly, the argument is made that pedestrianisation has been tried in other US cities and “it didn’t work.” These are all good points, and any new street design should take these and other considerations into account.</p>
          <p class="text">But, let’s remember the arguments against tearing down the “perfectly good” Camperdown bridge that is now the Liberty (walking!) Bridge. That $13 million public investment in the Falls Park project stimulated well over $100 million in private investment that has transformed downtown Greenville. Our Main Street has become a case study for cities across the country and internationally for how to revitalize a city. We should continue to lead and make Greenville’s Main Street a pedestrianised area, for the health of the city’s economy and for the health of our citizens.</p>
